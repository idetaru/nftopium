          worry about your NFTs being isolated from existing applications or

          In order to stimulate HODL QAS tokens at the initial stage among

          invited investors and earn real money already at an early stage of
          development. NFTOPIUM. Recommend participation in the NFTOPIUM Presale
          or the NFTOPIUM Sale using your personal link to make a profit here
          and now.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a user invests in QAS, then 10% of the amount of his payment
          provided to the referrer as a reward. At the same time, he receives +
          10% bonus in QAS tokens (from the amount paid). Thus 100% investment
          converted to QAS.

          QAS liquidity pools are added in an amount depending on the results of
          Presale and Sale, as well as in proportion to other assets in pairs
          according to the formula:% of collection in equivalent USD (30% and
          15%, respectively, from the calculation above) / amount QAS tokens (up

          That is, in the DAO: 125 million QAS to provide liquidity in the
          pools, and 125 million QAS to reward community members for
          contributions to the development of the DAO, including PR and
          Marketing, and to the development of self governance.

        <p>
          The main liquidity pool pair is QAS (BEP-20) to USDT (BEP-20).
          Wherein, if the user wants to exchange one of the BSC-supported crypto
          assets of the standard BEP-20, the protocol creates a layered

          It is possible to add (or extract) liquidity to the QUO farming pool
